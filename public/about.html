<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Sunil Kumar Sah, and I really enjoy two things in life: watching movies and playing cricket.<br>
   Movies are my jam, and I love all kinds of them. Cricket is my sport, and I'm pretty good at it
   I'm also known for being a good listener, which means I'm always there to chat or help out.</p>

<p>I'm a computer science student, and I absolutely love working with computers.<br>In fact, I'm so into it that I call my laptop my best friend!
  I'm always exploring new things on my computer and learning more about technology.</p>

<p>So, that's me Sunil Kumar Sah, a movie lover, cricket player, good listener, and a computer enthusiast.</p>
